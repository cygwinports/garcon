sdesc: "Xfce menu library (runtime)"
ldesc: "This is garcon, a freedesktop.org compliant menu implementation 
based on GLib and GIO. It was started as a complete rewrite of the 
former Xfce menu library called libxfce4menu, which, in contrast to 
garcon, was lacking menu merging features essential for loading menus 
modified with menu editors."
